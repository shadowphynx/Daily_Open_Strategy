Hi folks. I am glad to provide you with my preset that I use for trading PROP contests.    This preset has molded so that it can handle a prop firm rules.  I've only used it on 3 prop firms but based on how the preset is 
setup I think it has a great chance of either keeping the account positive and/or passing a challenge.
The preset can also be used to trade a regular account.  In that case you could tweak the lots/balance to provide larger lot sizes and thus get more gain.
